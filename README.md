# Friendify

## About Us

Friendify is an app used to make friends in these hard times when
it is so difficult to do so. Friendify takes into note the interests
of the user, and find people with the common interests.

The app uses firebase to store all the data of the users. The data is
used to make decision trees, to get people who have the common interests
as the user.

The app takes into consideration the movies, food, music and games the
user likes and create trees accordingly with the leaf nodes being all
the users of the app.

User can then add friends, according to the recommendations, and edit them
afterwards. They can visualize their friends and their friends' friends
using a graph, where the user and the friends are the vertices and their
friendship is a edge between them.

We are using PyInquirer and cutie to get inputs from the terminal, which is
used to navigate through the app.

## Working of the App ‚öôÔ∏è

![alt text](https://github.com/eeshannarula29/assets/blob/main/working.jpeg?raw=true)

Our app has four components, the IO and visualization libraries, Screen, Data handler and firebase database. 
All of them work in sync, to make the app work. 

### Data Flow
 - For getting data, signing in and registering, the Screen first sends a request to the IO libraries to return the information of the data which needs to be loaded from the Firebase database. </br>


- Then the libraries return the data to be retrieved, which the Screen requests the Data handler to retrieve. </br>


- The Data handler then sends a request to the firebase and in turn firebase returns the data to the Data handler. </br>


- The data handler then sends this data to our Screen which take an action accordingly.
