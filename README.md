# Friendify

## About Us

Friendify is an app used to make friends in these hard times when
it is so difficult to do so. Friendify takes into note the interests
of the user, and find people with the common interests.

The app uses firebase to store all the data of the users. The data is
used to make decision trees, to get people who have the common interests
as the user.

The app takes into consideration the movies, food, music and games the
user likes and create trees accordingly with the leaf nodes being all
the users of the app.

User can then add friends, according to the recommendations, and edit them
afterwards. They can visualize their friends and their friends' friends
using a graph, where the user and the friends are the vertices and their
friendship is a edge between them.

We are using PyInquirer and cutie to get inputs from the terminal, which is
used to navigate through the app.

## Working of the App ‚öôÔ∏è

![alt text](https://github.com/eeshannarula29/assets/blob/main/working.jpeg?raw=true)

Our app has four components, the IO and visualization libraries, Screen, Data handler and firebase database. 
All of them work in sync, to make the app work. 

### Data Flow
 - For getting data, signing in and registering, the Screen first sends a request to the IO libraries to return the information of the data which needs to be loaded from the Firebase database. </br>


- Then the libraries return the data to be retrieved, which the Screen requests the Data handler to retrieve. </br>


- The Data handler then sends a request to the firebase and in turn firebase returns the data to the Data handler. </br>


- The data handler then sends this data to our Screen which take an action accordingly. 

### Friend Recommendations
![alt text](https://github.com/eeshannarula29/assets/blob/main/tree.jpeg?raw=true)

- Friend recommendations are given using modified decision trees. The internal nodes are the preferences the users choose, and the root nodes are the users. </br>


- As a user can choose at most 3 subcategories for all the 4 categories (movies, music, games and food), so the user can be a root value at most 3 to the power 4 times in the tree. 


- For recommendation of friends, first this tree is created with all the data we initially have for all the users of the app.


- This tree is then searched for with all the possible 81 (3 to the power 4) preference sequences of a user, and all the users at the end of those Sequence are stored in a collection.


- Then we count how frequently the users are appearing in this collection, and sort the accordingly. 


- The user is shown the top 10 users who have appeared most frequently, as friend recommendations. 

#### Initial Data

Initially, the app had no users, so if people signed in they would not have been able to find any friends. Thus we conducted a survey in which we asked people about their preferences. Then we registered all of these users to our app.


The dataset is available in the data directory. We have scrapped the host address of the emails that the users have provided us, to maintain privacy.
