## About US

Friendify is an app used to make friends in these hard times when
it is so difficult to do so. Friendify takes into note the interests
of the user, and find people with the common interests.

The app uses firebase to store all the data of the users. The data is
used to make decision trees, to get people who have the common interests
as the user.

The app takes into consideration the movies, food, music and games the
user likes and create trees accordingly with the leaf nodes being all
the users of the app.

User can then add friends, according to the recommendations, and edit them
afterwards. They can visualize their friends and their friends' friends
using a graph, where the user and the friends are the vertices and their
friendship is a edge between them.

We are using PyInquirer and cutie to get inputs from the terminal, which is
used to navigate through the app.
