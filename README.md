# Friendify

## About Us

Friendify is an app used to make friends in these hard times when
it is so difficult to do so. Friendify takes into note the interests
of the user, and find people with the common interests.

The app uses firebase to store all the data of the users. The data is
used to make decision trees, to get people who have the common interests
as the user.

The app takes into consideration the movies, food, music and games the
user likes and create trees accordingly with the leaf nodes being all
the users of the app.

User can then add friends, according to the recommendations, and edit them
afterwards. They can visualize their friends and their friends' friends
using a graph, where the user and the friends are the vertices and their
friendship is a edge between them.

We are using PyInquirer and cutie to get inputs from the terminal, which is
used to navigate through the app.

## Usage


### Welcome Screen üôè

From here you can go onto signing in or registering. If you press exit you will get to the previous screen.

### Register 

If you go to registration, you would be asked for a new username. After your username you would have to answer some questions about your interests, which would be used to match you up with your new friends üëØ‚Äç. This is how it looks (its a gif, if it does not start click on it)

![alt text](https://github.com/eeshannarula29/assets/blob/main/registration_auth.gif?raw=true)

If you do something wrong don't worry you can change your answers afterwards üòÄ. After the registration the home screen will open (coming below ‚¨áÔ∏è).

### Sign In

For signing in you would just have to fill in your username with which you registered and your password, and your home screen will open üö™.

### Home Screen üè°

The recommendations are from the highest to the lowest matching score with you. You can now select anyone of them to see their profile. Let us select the user with the username "nothanks". This is what will pop up

After selecting one of the options, the screen shoudl look like this

You can type the url in your browser to to see a graph like this

## Working of the App ‚öôÔ∏è

![alt text](https://github.com/eeshannarula29/assets/blob/main/working.jpeg?raw=true)

Our app has four components, the IO and visualization libraries, Screen, Data handler and firebase database. 
All of them work in sync, to make the app work. 

### Data Flow
 - For getting data, signing in and registering, the Screen first sends a request to the IO libraries to return the information of the data which needs to be loaded from the Firebase database. </br>


- Then the libraries return the data to be retrieved, which the Screen requests the Data handler to retrieve. </br>


- The Data handler then sends a request to the firebase and in turn firebase returns the data to the Data handler. </br>


- The data handler then sends this data to our Screen which take an action accordingly. 

### Friend Recommendations
![alt text](https://github.com/eeshannarula29/assets/blob/main/tree.jpeg?raw=true)

- Friend recommendations are given using modified decision trees. The internal nodes are the preferences the users choose, and the leaf nodes are the users. </br>


- As a user can choose at most 3 subcategories for all the 4 categories (movies, music, games and food), so the user can be a leaf value at most 3 to the power 4 times in the tree. 


- For recommendation of friends, first this tree is created with all the data we initially have for all the users of the app.


- This tree is then searched for with all the possible 81 (3 to the power 4) preference sequences of a user, and all the users at the end of those Sequence are stored in a collection.


- Then we count how frequently the users are appearing in this collection, and sort the accordingly. 


- The user is shown the top 10 users who have appeared most frequently, as friend recommendations. 

#### Initial Data

Initially, the app had no users, so if people signed in they would not have been able to find any friends. Thus we conducted a survey in which we asked people about their preferences. Then we registered all of these users to our app.


The dataset is available in the data directory. We have scrapped the host address of the emails that the users have provided us, to maintain privacy.


### Network Visualization
All of our data is stored in firebase. The way it is stored is very similar to a graph object. The users stored in the database act like the vertices of the graph and the database acts like the graph itself. Each vertex stores its neighbours, which are other users in our case, and this edge between two users is the friendship between them.

Using this ideology, we then, for a specific user, get access to its vertex in the graph, and recursively got hold of their friends, their friends' friends and so on, to get formatted data for plotting a graph in Dash library. For now we have set the options for depth to be 1, 2 or 3, so user can see their friends their friends' friends, and thier friends' friends' friends.

## Bugs to Fix üêû

- People who are already friends, should not be shown as recommendations

## Todo and Ideas üí°

- [ ] customize graph layouts
- [x] add authentication with password
- [ ] Friendify network, contaning all the users
