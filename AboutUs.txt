About US

Friendify is an app used to make friends in these hard times when
it is so difficult to do so. Friendify takes into note the interests
of the user, and find people with the common interests.

The app uses firebase to store all the data of the users. The data is
used to make many decision trees, to get people who have the common
interests as the user. We are using PyInquirer and cutie to get inputs
from the terminal.

The app takes into consideration the movies, food, music and games the
user likes and create trees accordingly with the leaf nodes being all
the users of the app.
